At higher temperatures, benthic invertebrates bury deeper into the sediment. Their predators, such as shorebirds, therefore require flexibility in their foraging mode. Previous studies in a variety of taxa (Black-tailed Godwit: Dominguez 2002; Western Sandpiper, Nebel and Thompson 2005; plover?, Pienkowski 1983) have shown that shorebirds do indeed increase the proportion of deep probes into the sediment at higher temperatures, and reduce the number of pecks from the surface.

These observations have implications for birds' energy intakes, as surface pecks are typically directed at different prey items to deep probes, ]and may involve a greater role of vision, and less of other senses]. As different prey items have different energetic contents, this change in foraging strategy has clear implications for the potential energy intake of birds during different surface temperatures. 

However, previous models of energy intake have ignored this source of variation. In this study, we recorded sediment temperature as well as footage of foraging individuals of two species of shorebird , Calidris alba and C. fuscicollis. From this footage we calculated the proportion of pecks to probes, and were able to relate it to sediment temperature. We also used records of air temperature and solar radiation from a nearby weather station to test whether these data were able to predict changes in the birds' behaviour, thus obviating the need for direct sediment measurements.
