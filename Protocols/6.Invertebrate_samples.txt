On days when benthic invertebrates were sampled, I first located a flock as for activity scans. However, I then collected sediment samples from the area where birds were feeding using a corer with 10 cm diameter and 5 cm depth. These samples were sieved in situ through a 0.5 mm mesh and preserved in ethanol until identification.
