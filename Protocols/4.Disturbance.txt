I recorded when flocks were disturbed during sampling. A disturbance event was defined as any member of another species approaching the flock, causing birds to move or change their behaviour. I recorded the cause of the disturbance where possible in the following categories:
—human, walking or cycling
—human, driving a motorised terrestrial vehicle
—dog
—predator
—aircraft
—other
