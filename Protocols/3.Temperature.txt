I collected sediment temperature at a depth of 3 cm, using a bulb thermometer held in the sediment for two minutes: this period was found to be sufficient for the temperature to stabilise even between extremes of temperature in a pilot study. 

Temperature was recorded in two locations, effectively defined as the foraging areas were above. First in the intertidal zone in line with where birds were seen feeding, generally far up enough the beach to be washed by waves only once or twice per minute. Immediately afterwards, I recorded temperature in the dry sand of the upper beach, between the high tide line and the dunes, if possible where birds were seen feeding.

I attempted to collect at least one temperature reading per hour; however, if this was not possible without disturbing the flock being sampled the measurement was postponed.
