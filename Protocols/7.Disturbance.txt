Flocks were located by driving from the barra of the lagoon towards the Balne√°rio Mostardense in a car along the upper beach.

When a flock was located, the car was parked approximately 70m from the flock. One of two experimenters then walked slowly towards the flock. When the majority of members in the flock had walked or flown from their original location, the distance from the experimenter to the estimated centre of the original flock was calculated by counting paces, which were subsequently converted to SI units using known lengths.

This rapid method enabled all experiments to be conducted in a single day, avoiding sampling the same individuals repeatedly and without variation in levels of non-experimental disturbance (no static vehicles, fishermen or dogs were observed during the experiment).

As the overwhelming majority of flocks contained both species, and any aggregations of roosting birds were immediately adjacent to foraging flocks, neither species identity nor flock behaviour were included in these analyses.
