In between scan samples I videoed focal individuals from within the sampled flock, in order to observe and quantify feeding behaviour and identify prey. I attempted to record 1 minute of footage; however, in some conditions - for example very strong winds, or frequent disturbance from traffic at some points of the weekend - this was not possible, as birds did not feed in the same place for a minute before flying. All videos over 20 s in length were therefore included, in order to represent foraging tactics during high-disturbance periods.
