Sanderlings:

Flocks roosting on the upper beach were observed as the tide rose. Once a flock had been present for at least half an hour, I walked to the central area of the flock and collected faecal samples from the ground. Sanderling flocks contained no or few individuals of other species. 

Birds typically did not continue to roost on a falling tide, and would remain in the same location until waters rose sufficiently to wash away faecal samples. Therefore, waiting on the rising tide and then disturbing the flock was the only way to collect large numbers of samples.


White-rumped Sandpipers:

This species tended to roost so close to the waters edge that faecal samples were washed away within minutes. Therefore, single-species flocks (or flocks with very few heterospecific individuals) were sought feeding close to or above the highest waves. These flocks were then disturbed and samples collected until the waves removed the faecal matter, at which point another flock was sought.

While static roost sites for this species do exist further inland (at the lagoa do peixe or small pools within the sand dunes), birds roosting there are mixed with birds who foraged in non-marine habitats, such as lakes. Collecting faeces from flocks foraging on the beach ensured that those birds use that habitat.
